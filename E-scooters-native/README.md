# E Scooters Native

React-Native App aiming to compare E-scooters offers in the surroundings of the user.

## Setup

### Before starting: WSL 

If you're used to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run `node` and `npm`, and your WSL doesn't have access to your USB ports, and you want to run the application on an actual device, I recommend to download `node` for `windows` (It's very very easier to dead with USB ports).

### Environment Setup

Follow [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#Using-a-virtual-device), with `React Native CLI QuickStart` tab selected. 

**Skip the part about *Creating a new application***, and `git clone https://github.com/Doreapp/E-Scooters-Native` instead. 

### Run the app on an actual device 

See [Running On Device](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device) page, it explains well things, depending on your OS (both PC and smartphone)
